A Little Book is just an HTML document with some clever styling. To get the pages to print out right, they're positioned absolutely and rotated with CSS. The book itself is generated by the static site tool Jekyll, so the pages can be written in HTML, Markdown, or even plain text if you like. You can theme the book with CSS, overriding our default `theme.css`.
